===========

Publish your API into your LAN, for API development.

It's like GhostLab http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/

**It seems that ngrok is the best way to do it. I will include it in gem and provide Rails friendly shortcuts. :)**

`rails ns` to run an app server and publish your rails app onto https://#{some_randomstr}.ngrok.com/ while you are running the server.

It has `rails server` compatible options.
